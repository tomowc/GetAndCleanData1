Here you can find information about data collected in file tidy.txt. This dataset consists of 14220 observations -- each relates to the average value of some variable calculated for each of the volunteers in the experiment for each of the activity performed by them. There were 30 participants in the experiment and each performed 6 activities. Then many, many different variables were obtained ;)

There are 4 variables in this dataset:
* *subject* -- id of the volunteer,
* *activity* -- name of the activity performed,
* *variable* -- name of the variable measured,
* *mean* -- average value of the variable for this participant and activity.

**I suppose this should be much longer. But the details of the transformation performed on the dataset are in the README file, and just coping things from the original descriptions of the data seems inappropriate. Anyway, any feedback will be very helpful.**
